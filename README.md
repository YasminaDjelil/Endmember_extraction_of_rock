# Rock Art Spectral Analysis

In our study of rock art using various hyperspectral imaging (HSI) techniques, we observed that the rocks containing the panels typically exhibit multiple spectral signatures. These variations are due to factors like differing rock components, the presence of casts, vegetation, and more.

This project aims to employ diverse endmember extraction methods to accurately map the rock surfaces.

## Goals
- Analyze hyperspectral data of rock art.
- Identify and separate different spectral signatures.
- Apply endmember extraction techniques for precise rock surface mapping.
